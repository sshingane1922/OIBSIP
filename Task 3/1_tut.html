            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Ferruccio Lamborghini (Italian pronunciation:28 April 1916-20 February 1993) was an Italian automobile
                designer, inventor, mechanic, engineer, winemaker, industrialist and businessman who created Automobili
                Lamborghini in 1963, a maker of high-end sports cars in Sant'Agata Bolognese.

                Born to grape farmers in Renazzo, from the comune of Cento in the Emilia-Romagna region, his mechanical
                know-how led him to enter the business of tractor manufacturing in 1948, when he founded Lamborghini
                Trattori, which quickly became an important manufacturer of agricultural equipment in the midst of
                Italy's post-WWII economic boom. In 1959, he opened an oil burner factory, Lamborghini Bruciatori, which
                later entered the business of producing air conditioning equipment.

                Lamborghini founded a fourth company, Lamborghini Oleodinamica, in 1969 after creating Automobili
                Lamborghini in 1963. Lamborghini sold off many of his interests by the late 1970s and retired to an
                estate in Umbria, where he pursued winemaking.</p>
            <p>In 1974, Lamborghini exited the industrial world and retired to a 3 km2 (740 acres) estate named "La
                Fiorita" on the shores of Lake Trasimeno, in Castiglione del Lago, a town in the Umbria region of
                central Italy.[18][19] Returning to his farming roots, Lamborghini delighted in hunting and producing
                his own wines. Lamborghini even designed his own golf course, all while continuing to manage several
                business interests.[9][16]

                Lamborghini fathered a child, Patrizia, at age 58.

                At 76 years of age, on 20 February 1993, Lamborghini died at Silvestrini Hospital in Perugia after
                suffering a heart attack fifteen days earlier.[18] Lamborghini is buried at the cemetery of Renazzo.</p>
